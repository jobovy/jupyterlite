# Accessing local files

The `jupyterlab-filesystem-access` extension allows accessing local files using the
(non-standard) Web Browser File System Access API.

The extension is available on [GitHub][filesystem-access-github] and published to
[PyPI][filesystem-access-pypi] . It is compatible with both JupyterLab and JupyterLite.

See the section below to learn how to add extensions to your deployment.

```{warning}
This extension is compatible with Chromium-based browsers only (for now).

See the [MDN][mdn] documentation for more information.
