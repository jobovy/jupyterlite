# Using a custom Pyodide distribution

Beneath [custom wheels](./wheels.md) are the raw JS and WebAssembly parts of `pyolite`
provided by [pyodide](https://pyodide.org). As the full distribution is very large, and
self-hosting of all its assets brings their own challenges, this use of CDN is the
default for JupyterLite.

A custom `pyodide.js`, along with its `packages.json` and the rest of its assets, such
as might be downloaded via the
[`--pyodide` CLI option](../../reference/cli.ipynb#pyodide), can also be configured.
This can be either relative to the `lite_dir`, or as a full URL.

```json
"jupyter-config-data": {
  "litePluginSettings": {
    "@jupyterlite/pyolite-kernel-extension:kernel": {
      "pyodideUrl": "./path/to/custom/pyodide/pyodide.js"
    }
  }
}
```
