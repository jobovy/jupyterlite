# Deploying on Binder with `jupyter-server-proxy`

A JupyterLite can be deployed behind `jupyter-server-proxy` using any
[local server](../../quickstart/standalone.md) method. This is a good way to preview
deployment interactively of a e.g. Lab extension that can work in both the "full" binder
experience, and as a static preview.

```{hint}
See the JupyterLite [binder configuration] for an example.
```
